# Netflix-Clone
This Project is a clone of The Netflix Website which is an American over-thetop media service and original programming production company. It offers subscription-based video on demand from a library of films and television series, 40% of which is Netflix original programming produced in-house. Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries and more – on thousands of internetconnected devices. You can watch as much as you want, whenever you want, without a single ad – all for one low monthly price. There's always something new to discover, and new TV shows and movies are added every week! Our Cloned Website is fully responsive to all mobile devices even the small one. It is as perfect as the official Netflix website. The website consists of 4 HTML and 4 CSS files each made separately and then linked to each other using hyperlinks.
